The Amplify Repository is where Axway-issued artifacts or product extensions are available for you to download directly from the **Amplify Platform**. Previously, the Axway Marketplace was where we had distributed Axway and 3rd party product extensions for a variety of Axway products and services. The Amplify Repository provides you a simpler and more consistent way to access and download your content through the Platform.

You can access the repository directly using the URL [https://repository.axway.com](https://repository.axway.com) or from the Download Center - **Extensions** link in the Platform's top navigation **Help & Resources** menu.

From the **Download Center** link, you can also click the **Products** link to go to the [Support Portal](https://support.axway.com/en/downloads/index/type/Downloads) downloads page.

{{% alert title="Note" color="primary" %}}Titanium artifacts are no longer available through the **Amplify Platform**. If you need access to a Titanium artifact, or if you have questions about artifacts that you have purchased through the Axway Marketplace previously, please contact Axway at [marketplace-admin@axway.com](mailto:marketplace-admin@axway.com).{{% /alert %}}
