## Platform Management 8.9.3 - 21 October 2021

Platform Management 8.9.3 is a patch release which includes one improvement.

As of this release, all Support, Community, and other Axway portal user accounts have now been merged with their corresponding **Amplify Platform** accounts. For users which did not yet have an **Amplify Platform** account, an **Amplify Platform** account has been created and their credentials will remain the same. For existing users with both portal and **Amplify Platform** accounts, their **Amplify Platform** account credentials should now be used to sign in.

## Improvement

* Added messaging on the _Sign In_ form shown after a failed login attempt guiding portal users to use their **Amplify Platform** account credentials to sign in.
