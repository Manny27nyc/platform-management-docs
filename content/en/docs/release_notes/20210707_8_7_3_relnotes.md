## Platform Management 8.7.3 - 7 July 2021

Platform Management 8.7.3 is a patch release which includes an improvement and a bug fix.

## Improvements

* For organizations using their own Identity Provider, improved the verbiage on the _Credentials_ view to clarify scope of use of tooling credentials. Added a link to the corresponding documentation.

## Fixed issues

* Fixed an issue where the _Organization Overview_ Subscription status dropdown table may not include the correct set of statuses or allow filtering the subscriptions within the table.
