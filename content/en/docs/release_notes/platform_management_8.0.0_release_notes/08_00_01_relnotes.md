## Platform Management 8.0.1 - 23 July 2020

Platform Management 8.0.1 is an incremental release, which includes a few improvements and a bug fix.

## Improvements

* Performed minor revisions and usability improvements to the common header and the _Amplify Platform Home_, _Organization_, and _Account_ views.
* Reordered "My Capabilities" and key tasks sections of _Amplify Platform Home_ to promote Central, Catalog, and Integration Builder offerings.
* Removed the Applications, Mobile Backend Services Datasources, and Amplify Runtime Services counts on the organization _Usage_ view.

## Fixed issues

* Fixed an issue where the services listed in the common header's service (left most) menu and capabilities and tasks shown on _Amplify Platform Home_ may not include all services subscribed or provisioned for the organization or available for the user's role.
